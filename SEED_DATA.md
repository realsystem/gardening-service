    days_to_germination_min, days_to_germination_max,
    days_to_harvest, spacing_inches, row_spacing_inches,
    sun_requirement, water_requirement,
    description, growing_notes, tags
) VALUES (
    'Basil', 'Ocimum basilicum', 'Genovese',
    5, 10, 60, 10, 12,
    'full_sun', 'medium',

    'herb,aromatic,culinary,warm-season'
);
```

### Updating Existing Varieties

```

## Migration Scripts

### Expanded Catalog (Current)
**File:** [`migrations/seed_plant_varieties_expanded.sql`](migrations/seed_plant_varieties_expanded.sql)

**Features:**
- Deletes existing plant varieties (DELETE FROM plant_varieties)
- Inserts 107 plant varieties with complete data
- Covers vegetables, fruits, herbs, grains, cover crops, specialty plants
- All varieties have scientific names, growing data, and proper categorization
- Tags stored as comma-separated strings
- Idempotent (can be run multiple times)

**Categories:**
- Vegetables: 45 varieties
- Fruits: 20 varieties
- Herbs: 15 varieties
- Grains: 5 varieties
- Cover Crops: 5 varieties
- Pollinator Flowers: 8 varieties
- Microgreens: 5 varieties
- Perennial Vegetables: 4 varieties

### Basic Catalog (Original)
**File:** [`migrations/seed_plant_varieties.sql`](migrations/seed_plant_varieties.sql)

**Features:**
- Original 27-variety catalog
- Focus on common vegetables, herbs, and microgreens
- Good starting point for basic gardening

**Warning:** Both scripts use `DELETE FROM plant_varieties` which will remove all existing varieties but preserve related data through foreign key constraints. User data (seed batches, plantings, etc.) will remain but reference plant varieties by ID.
